Conceptually splitting functions into 3 concepts (blocks, procs, and lambdas) does nothing for the language. Macros and <code>method_missing</code> are highly unreadable. Indexing an array or a map out of bounds returns nil. etc. Im open to hearing another opinion on this, but Ruby is low B-tier.</p><p>p.s: good tier lists. Very fun!</p>", post: 'tier-lists'},
