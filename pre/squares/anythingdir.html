.desc {{
"[anything] [direction]" is defined as follows:
"Do [anything],
but smoothly turn either 1/4 less or more
to end as if the call were "[anything], quarter [direction]".
}}
If the [anything] ends in a preposition,
you can drop it
(e.g. "rip off in" can be pronounced "rip in").
</p>

<p>
Here are some definitions of existing calls with this concept:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>{zing} = zoom in</li>
    <li>{shakedown} = rip in</li>
    <li>{explode} = stable cast off 1/4 in</li>
    <li>{ease off} = ends zoom, centers circulate in</li>
    <li>{couple up} = split counter rotate in</li>
    <li>[rh waves] {tandem quarter out} = peel right</li>
    <li>[rh waves] {tandem partner tag} = trail left</li>
    <li>[rh waves] {2/3 recycle} = recycle left</li>
    <li>[couple] {beaus fold} = hinge right (up to space invasion)</li>
    <li>[couple] {beaus run} = partner tag right (= trade outright, lol)</li>
    <li>[couple] {partner tag} = trade out</li>
    <li>[facing couples] {half sashay} = left partner tag in</li>
    <li>[rh waves] centers partner tag, ends face right = slither in (say it out loud)</li>
    <li>[eight chain] {pass in} = pass in. Sadly, they're not equivalent in general because {pass in} uses a {face in} rather than a {1/4 in}.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are also some nice things that don't have names,
like "little left" to get from a right-handed quarter tag
to a starting double pass thru.
