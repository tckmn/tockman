The <em>phony</em> concept
is a combination of <em>funny</em> and <em>own</em>.
}}
The syntax is
<strong>phony X by Y</strong>,
defined as "some people do X and some people do Y,
such that as many people as possible do X without crashing".

<h2>examples</h2>

<ul>

    <li>[2FL] {couples twosome circulate}: phony split circulate by crossover circulate</li>
    <li>[inverted lines] {cross walk &amp; dodge}: phony walk &amp; dodge by split trade circulate</li>
    <li>[facing lines] {finish scramble}: phony press in by turn thru</li>
    <li>[facing couples] {fan thru to a wave}: phony trail off by veer left</li>

</ul>

<p>
    Here's an extremely unreasonable example:
    "phony chain reaction, turn the star 1/2 by little"
    from this formation.
</p>

<p>
    Everyone does their part of a chain reaction, turn the star 1/2
    (with partner hinge and facing star)
    except the outside facing out,
    who does a little.
    It ends in right hand two faced lines.

<h2>history</h2>

<p>
    This concept was inspired
    by the call
    "own those who get the joke,
    split circulate by split phantom lines trade"
    from the following formation,
    jokingly proposed by Pi Fisher.
</p>

<p>
    "Those who get the joke"
    refers to the people who would move on a funny split circulate.
    (This is a reference to the pair of callbacks to funny:
    "ha" if you move and "I don't get it" if you don't.)
    In this case,
    it's the four dancers in the top left and bottom right quadrants.
    So they do a split circulate,
    and the others do a "flippy slim down" motion
    to end in a pinwheel formation.
</p>

<p>
    Seeing this,
    I had a different,
    even more nefarious idea:
    "own those who get the joke 'split circulate',
    partner trade by split circulate".
    Now the people who would <em>not</em> move on "funny split circulate"
    in fact do a split circulate,
    and the people who <em>would</em> move don't do it
    and instead do a (phantom) partner trade.
    This ends in another 2x4
    with everyone moved one spot clockwise in their box.
</p>

<p>
    I then also thought of a much better name for this:
    "own the giant alien spiders,
    split circulate by partner trade".
    Here "giant alien spiders"
    refers to the people who <em>don't</em> get the joke,
    because <a href='https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_alien_spiders'>giant alien spiders are, famously, no joke</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Finally,
    this gave rise to the phony concept,
    devised and named by Dylan Hendrickson.
    In particular,
    the last example
    is the same as "phony split circulate by reverse swap around".
