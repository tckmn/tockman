Sometimes the group-theoretic concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy_class'>conjugation</a>
is a useful one in defining calls.
}}
In particular,
"conjugate X by Y" means
"do Y, then do X, then do the inverse of Y".
There are a number of ways to define "inverse":
</p>

<ul>
    <!-- <li>identity (i.e. the inverse of Y is Y)</li> -->
    <li>rewind</li>
    <li>rewind mirror</li>
    <li>backnose</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Different ones are useful in different contexts,
    but "rewind mirror" is probably the most broadly natural
    (and it's the flavor I'll assume by default,
    unless otherwise specified).
</p>

<h2>examples</h2>

<ul>
    <li>{central load the boat}: conjugate central trip the set by pass thru</li>
    <li>{mix}: conjugate slide by slip</li>
    <li>{plenty}: conjugate split circ 2 by little. This is correct from a LH quarter tag; from a RH quarter tag you need the rewind flavor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ping pong</h2>

<p>
    The motivating example for the ping pong concept
    is the "definition" of {ping pong circulate}
    as "backnose-conjugate circulate by extend (but smoothly)".
    That is,
    extend,
    do an all 8 circulate,
    then "un-extend".
    This is kind of like thinking of a distorted 2x4
    in which there are "ping pong lines" (O and X)
    and "ping pong boxes" (red and green):

    They're very different, though.
    For example,
    "ping pong trade the wave"
    is just "centers trade the wave, ends trade"
    with the distorted formation definition.
    But with the conjugation definition,
    it ends in the same spots as "ping pong circulate, new centers trade the wave".
    (To be correct,
    the original ends should actually trade after passing the centers
    but before making their wave.)
</p>

<p>
    You could argue that the distorted formation definition
    is actually better,
    because it's easier and does nicer things.
    For example,
    from a quarter tag,
    it allows defining {jaywalk} as "ping pong slide"
    and {double cross} as "ping pong slither",
    whereas the conjugation definition
    makes the first one "do nothing"
    and the second one illegal.
</p>

<p>
    Anyway,
    the coolest thing about the conjugation definition
    is that from right hand waves,
    "ping pong little" is the same as "rewind mirror little"
    (i.e. the last part of {plenty}).
    There's no good reason,
    it just is.
