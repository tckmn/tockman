This is mostly novelty material I've written for fun;
you will be hard-pressed to find anything
resembling the traditional definition of "choreography".
}}
(I have also written more than 1,000 sequences of real choreography;
I don't want to put them all on my website,
but feel free to let me know if you want to do some data analysis on them or something.)

<h2 id='universal'>a sequence that always resolves</h2>

<p>
    This is a "universal sequence":
    it can start in <em>any</em> symmetric 2x4,
    and always ends in a "circle left n/8" resolve.
    (It can be pasted directly into <a href='https://challengedance.org/sd/'>sd</a>.)
</p>

<p>
    It even has some bonus properties:
    every call has someone moving
    (i.e. no "leads trade" with no leaders, or "funny X" where nobody gets it),
    there's no use of absolute directions
    ("headliners", "face the music"),
    and everything is kept at 90&deg; angles
    (getting to lines is easier with "1/8 in").

    Here's some rough intuition for how it works.
    The first block turns an arbitrary 2x4 into facing lines.
    The second block ensures the facing lines are made of normal couples.
    The third block gets a trade by of normal couples
    with heads as ends and sides as centers.
    The fourth block pairs the sides with their partners.
    The fifth block does the same for the heads.
    Finally,
    the last block ensures the couples are in sequence
    (at which point "circle home" can be called).

<h2 id='illegal'>illegal sequences</h2>

<p>
Here are a few sequences with totally illegal calls
that hopefully are intuitive enough anyway.
(The starred call is the one in question.)
</p>

<p>
Note:
I wrote these when I was much worse at writing sequences,
and I want to improve them some day.
They still serve to show off the gimmick, though.
