This is mostly novelty material I've written for fun;
you will be hard-pressed to find anything
resembling the traditional definition of "choreography".

<h2 id='universal'>a sequence that always resolves</h2>

<p>
    This is a "universal sequence":
    it can start in <em>any</em> symmetric 2x4,
    and always ends in a "circle left n/8" resolve.
    (It can even be pasted directly into <a href='https://challengedance.org/sd/'>sd</a>.)
</p>

<p class='seq'>

1/4 stable emulate swap around<br>

echo centers 1/4 in<br><br>

boys trade<br>

</p>

<p>
    Here's some rough intuition for how it works.
    The first block turns an arbitrary 2x4 into facing lines.
    The second block ensures the facing lines are made of normal couples.
    The third block gets a trade by of normal couples
    with heads as ends and sides as centers.
    The fourth block pairs the sides with their partners.
    The fifth block does the same for the heads.
    Finally,
    the last block ensures the couples are in sequence
    (at which point "circle home" can be called).

<h2 id='illegal'>illegal sequences</h2>

<p>
Here are a few sequences with totally illegal calls
that hopefully are intuitive enough anyway.
(The starred call is the one in question.)

<h2 id='amateur2022'>amateur night, hard plus (2022-08-16)</h2>

<p>
    Here's a patter tip I wrote and called
    for a Tech Squares amateur night.
    Tech Squares has lots of challenge and strong plus dancers,
    so these skew very weird/hard.

I also did a singer,
with a custom edit of Lights by Ellie Goulding
(which I probably shouldn't post here
because it'd be illegal or something).
