Here's a bunch of square-shaped ramblings

<h2>jokes</h2>

<ul>
    <li>By analogy with {switch to a diamond} and {switch to an hourglass}, {ends cut in} could be described as "switch to a crossover"... and {trade} is "switch to a split".</li>
    <li>{plus|explode} shouldn't be a plus call. Based on its name, it should be C4.</li>
</ul>

<h2>anecdotes</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        There was a pool dance I participated in at a squares weekend (it's exactly what it sounds like, just a square dance but in a pool. We did one on an ice rink too). My favorite moment was "pass to the cen- wait, no, dive thru!!"
    </li>

        The <a href='https://www.danceinfo.org/uploads/2/4/6/6/24661272/peasfrozen20.pdf'>frozen peas</a> anecdote
        is documented in a few places on the internet;
        however,
        it's been extended even further at Tech Squares.
        Our callback is "Kevin's peas are frozen!",
        because a member named Kevin was the one who first introduced it here.
        Apparently,
        even knowledge of this one has spread;
        at IAGSDC 2022,
        when Sandie Bryant called a mini-busy in a hall with enough Tech Squares dancers,
        she was ready to retort to our "Kevin's peas are frozen!"
        with an immediate and deadpan "...they are not".
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>observations</h2>

<ul>
    <li>From an eight chain, "circulate once and a half" is the same as "circulate a half, circulate a half".</li>
    <li>From facing lines, 1/2 stable regroup = hocus pocus.</li>
    <li>There's an obvious generalization to define zip code 0: centers 1/4 out and jog (that's either cast back or press out).</li>
    <li>The word "spin" has many meanings:
        <ul>
            <li>swing, e.g. {spin the top} vs {C3A|the top}</li>
            <li>swing slip, e.g. {spin the windmill} vs {the windmill}</li>
            <li>hinge by 1/2 x 3/4, e.g. {spin chain thru} vs {C1|chain thru}</li>
            <li>left touch 3/4, e.g. {rotary spin} vs {rotary}</li>
            <li>right touch 3/4, e.g. {spin the pulley} vs {the pulley}</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
