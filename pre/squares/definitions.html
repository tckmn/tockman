.title Alternative "definitions" - Square dancing
.subpage

<p>
.desc {{
Since square dancing has a lot of vocabulary,
some calls can be described in many ways.
}}
Sometimes these might be easier to remember than the real definition;
other times they might just be silly / fun.
Here's a collection of some I've come up with.
</p>

<ul>

    <li>@spin chain thru@: piecewise generous thirdly fractal 4/5 any hand swing the fractions</li>

    <li>@crossfire@: couples 1/4 twosome trade (from 2FL)</li>

    <li>@scoot back@: tandem twosome trade</li>

    <li>@double pass thru@: cross concentric pass thru</li>

    <li>@pass the ocean@: fractal fan the top</li>

    <li>@linear cycle@: hinge, circulate, couple up (works for advanced too)</li>

    <li>@peel off@: tandem 1/4 twosome u turn back outwards</li>

    <li>@trail off@: tandem 1/4 twosome trade</li>

    <li>@pass &amp; roll@: (touch and) scoot back and circulate</li>

    <li>@C1|recycle@: hinge, ends drag the centers couples hinge. This works for both facing couples recycle and box recycle!</li>

    <li>
        @plenty@: little, split circ 2, rewind (left) little.
        This feels like the "right" way to think of this call.
        (It's also a <a href='../conjugate'>conjugation</a>.)
        Choose the mirroredness of the rewind little
        such that you turn in roll direction at the end.
    </li>

    <li>@grand single cross trade &amp; wheel@: hinge, grand working as centers catch 1. Similar things go for the rest of the family.</li>

    <li>@walk out to a wave@: #1-#3 are tandems of 3 1/4 threesome, box circulate; trailing ends run</li>

    <li>@grand chain eight@: funny right pull by, mirror 1/2 circulate, hinge like a couple up. This is definitely the "right" way to think of the call, in my opinion.</li>

    <li>@stack the line@: tandem partner 1/2 tag. Another "morally correct" definition to me.</li>

    <li>
        @plan ahead@: 1±1/2 circulate, hinge, cross concentric vertical 3/4∓1/4 tag,
        new ends working (rewind hinge and) roll as if you could.
        This is really silly.
    </li>

    <li>@flare out to a line@: couples twosome 1/2 zoom</li>

    <li>@link up@: couples 1/4 twosome peel and trail</li>

    <li>@rally@: little, triple boxes 1/2 zoom, very centers trade</li>

    <li>@central rally@: "swing, slip". This is completely wrong, but it's homotopic to the right thing!</li>

    <li>@(n) steps at a time@: first (n) are tandem (n)some 1/4 solid, grand peel and trail and roll</li>

    <li>@good show@: ends working stable couple up. This one is particularly well known, I think.</li>

    <li>@revolve to a wave@: leading belles u turn back (away from center), recycle</li>

    <li>@replace the column@: tandem tandem 1/2 twosome single (left) loop and 1/2 tag. The tag is left if from a RH column, right otherwise.</li>

    <li>@triple cast@: ends (of each wave) disconnected fan back, <a href='../systemizations#finishit'>finish it</a></li>

</ul>
