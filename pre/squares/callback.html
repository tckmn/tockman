.title Callbacks and flourishes

<p>
.desc {{
Styling is anything done in response to a call
that is not part of the call's definition.
}}
This might be an extra verbal or physical action,
or it might be a different way of dancing the call
that still ends up in the same place.
</p>

<p>
Many members of Tech Squares
enthusiastically adopt many styling elements
common throughout the square dancing world.
But we've invented some new ones, too.

<h2>callbacks (sound effects)</h2>

<p>
Communication between the caller and the dancers in square dancing
is not one-way --
the caller is usually the one saying things to the dancers,
but sometimes the dancers say things back.
These are referred to as "callbacks" at Tech Squares,
though I believe the more standard term is "sound effects".
</p>

<p>
The IAGSDC History wiki
also documents
<a href='https://www.iagsdchistory.org/wiki/Sound_Effects'>some of the more widespread sound effects</a>,
which overlaps partially with this list,
but for the most part these are largely confined to Tech Squares.

<ul>
    <li>@allemande left@: one clap <ul><li>According to Tech Squares caller Ted Lizotte, "If you step in a supermarket and say Allemande Left, you'll hear the square dancers clap." In practice, this is only common at a handful of clubs.</li></ul></li>
    <li>@couples trade@: "trade, trade, trade..." <ul><li>This is repeated until the call ends. It is sometimes extended to other as-couples calls, like @couples hinge@.</li></ul></li>
    <li>@left swing thru@: "left?!" <ul><li>This alerts dancers to when the less common handedness is used. The same callback, or "right?!", is also heard for other calls with handedness, like veers, leads, circles, etc.</li></ul></li>
    <li>@lines forward and back@: "thru!" <ul><li>This is a joke, referring to the call @lines (anything) thru@.</li></ul></li>
    <li>@wheel and deal@: "wheeling!" or "dealing!" from lines back-to-back <ul><li>The belle couple is wheeling (because it feels like a wheel around), and the beau couple is dealing (with the other two dancers trying to get in front of them).</li></ul></li>
    <li>@chain down the line@: centers say "catch me, turn me!"</li>
    <li>@ladies center, men sashay@: as eloquently phrased by the IAGSDC wiki, "ladies whoop it up"</li>
    <li>@u-turn back@: "u-turn back?!"</li>
    <li>@all 8 circulate@: "all circ-eightulate!" <ul><li>Other circulates are also spoonerized, like "circ splitulate", "circum colulate", "circond dimulate", etc. As a special case, @couples circulate@ is "like bunnies!" (often while hopping up and down), referring to the would-be spoonerism "circles copulate".</li></ul></li>
    <li>@zoom@: there are several: <ul>
            <li>"0-2-1-3-4" referencing <a href='https://zoomseries.fandom.com/wiki/ZOOM_Address_Song'>an old TV show</a></li>
            <li>"wah-wah" TODO</li>
            <li>"you're on mute!" post-pandemic referencing the videoconferencing platform</li>
        </ul></li>
</ul>
