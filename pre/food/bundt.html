<p>
For a bit of backstory,
I square dance with <a href='https://www.mit.edu/~tech-squares/'>Tech Squares</a>
every Tuesday night
(I promise this is relevant).
There are a lot of calls in square dancing
(over 1,000 at the highest level),
and one of them happens to be called Sock It To Me.
This is a reference to the once-extremely-popular TV show <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_%26_Martin%27s_Laugh-In'><em>Laugh-In</em></a>.
It also happens that there is a Bundt cake recipe
called Sock It To Me cake,
presumably also a reference to the show.
</p>

<p>
Of course,
being born 30 years after <em>Laugh-In</em> aired,
I have absolutely no association with the phrase "Sock It To Me"
other than square dancing.
So when I learned of this recipe
with the same hyper-specific name
as a call in the extremely niche group activity I do with my friends
where people often bring baked goods to share --
the next step was obvious.
</p>

<p>
At first,
I just wanted to make a Sock It To Me cake,
but I didn't have a Bundt pan.
So I bought one for this purpose,
but then it seemed silly to use it for literally one thing only,
and also I felt very powerful with my newfound fun-cake-shape abilities.
And <em>then</em> I couldn't decide what other flavor to make
because there were too many I wanted to try,
and...
this got somewhat out of hand,
and I have made a different Bundt cake
every week (that Tech Squares has met) since then.

So here are pictures of all <!--b--> cakes so far,

There's also a lot more pictures that aren't shown,
some of them showing the baking process,
which you can click the button next to the pictures to see.
