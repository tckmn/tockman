This is the first standard logic puzzle I made – I don't think it's very good, but it's not bad either.

This one is well worth doing logically – the deductions aren't hard but work well together.

I made these puzzles to demonstrate how <a href='https://twitter.com/chaotic_puzzles/status/1259012122878423041'>"penalty theory" in Heyawake</a> can be applied locally. The first can be solved with standard deductions somewhat painfully, so to fix that I made the second one, which definitely requires penalty theory to be solved by a human (and is quite an interesting design in its own right).

Was trying to make a shakashaka to demonstrate some basic deductions, but ended up with a mediocre puzzle instead, which was <i>just</i> decent enough to not throw away.

A triplet with varying forms of symmetry! It's hard to make a Tatebo-Yokobo with nontrivial logic, so these difficulty ratings are relative to the type. It's especially hard with symmetry and theme constraints, but I did my best with these.</p><p>Thanks a ton to @lovemathboy for testing these (and notifying me two were broken)!

The first one is a mini-demo of a deduction required for the second one, so it's a bit of a spoiler for the big puzzle.

At the time of writing, there are only 6 Araf puzzles in the puzz.link database. So I decided to fix that!</p><p>Thanks to @IHNN and @jkittykitkat for testing and catching a uniqueness issue.

A few moderately interesting Akari around the same logical theme -- the difficulty on these is hard to calibrate because they're quite easy if you know the deductions and quite hard if you don't, so I've set them at mid.
