This is the first standard logic puzzle I made – I don't think it's very good, but it's not bad either.

This one is well worth doing logically – the deductions aren't hard but work well together.

I made these puzzles to demonstrate how <a href='https://twitter.com/chaotic_puzzles/status/1259012122878423041'>"penalty theory" in Heyawake</a> can be applied locally. The first can be solved with standard deductions somewhat painfully, so to fix that I made the second one, which definitely requires penalty theory to be solved by a human (and is quite an interesting design in its own right).

Not too easy, not too hard.

Was trying to make a shakashaka to demonstrate some basic deductions, but ended up with a mediocre puzzle instead, which was <i>just</i> decent enough to not throw away.
