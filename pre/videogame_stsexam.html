<p style='color:#f11;font-style:italic'>
    Note: The original version of the exam has been modified
    with several errata;
    please see the updated version below.
</p>

<p>
    This is a written exam about the video game Slay the Spire.
    Why does such a thing exist,
    you might ask?
    The main reason is that I thought it would be really funny.
    Also,
    I think it's a cool way to share some tactics puzzles
    and some fun trivia about the game.
    But mostly it's for the memes.

    The exam was released on 2025-08-28.
    The solutions will be released no earlier than 1 week later (2025-09-04),
    so that people have time to try it.
    (I may delay longer, if people are still having fun or if anyone requests it or if I'm busy playing Silksong.)
    <span style='color:#f11;font-style:italic'>
        Update: There has been at least one request for an extension,
        so the actual solutions release date will be later.
        Further update: Solutions are now released!

    If you have a written submission
    and would like me to check your answers,
    feel free to <a href='/contact'>send it to me</a>.
    If you don't want to write things up
    but just want live commentary as you look at it and answer some of the questions,
    I would also enjoy hanging out in your STS Discord stream or Twitch chat or whatever,
    just let me know.

    Some commentary:
    The exam is unreasonably long and difficult.
    You probably shouldn't attempt the whole thing in one sitting,
    though I'm not stopping you.
    The idea is to have fun;
    some questions might strike you as unreasonable amounts of work,
    in which case you should skip them.
    Of course,
    if you send me a submission,
    it <em>will</em> be graded,
    but yknow it's not like it counts for anything.

    (this is to show that I actually made a full writeup before releasing the exam,
    and am not just stalling for time while I finish it :P)
    <span style='color:#f11;font-style:italic'>
        The solutions have since been revised,
        but <a href='OLD_stsexam1-v1-solu-v1.pdf'>here is the original PDF</a> with matching hash.
