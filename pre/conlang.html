.title Conlangs

<p>
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language'>Constructed languages</a>
are languages invented by individuals
rather than naturally developed,
for purposes ranging from facilitating communication between speakers of different languages
(the most famous being <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto'>Esperanto</a>)
to simply serving as works of art.

        In 1921,
        Jacob Linzbach invented a writing system based on mathematical notation
        and published his work in a little-known book
        written in the now-obsolete international auxiliary language Occidental.
        Here is a transcription and translation of the book
        about the writing system called <a href='/transalg'>Transcendental Algebra</a>.
